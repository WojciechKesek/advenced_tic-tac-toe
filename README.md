# Advenced tic tac toe game

This simple app was created as an extension of the application created in the course.

In this version, we can choose the size of the board. When choosing a non-standard size, we enter an advanced game mode, where we have to fill in 4 characters side by side to win.

It was created as a fun way to practice the basics of Java, and could be made in much simpler form but I made some unnecessary complication just to practice.
