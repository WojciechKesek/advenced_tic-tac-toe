# Advenced tic tac toe game

This simple app was created as an extension of a course-based application.

Here, users have the possibility to choose the size of the game board.
Choosing non-standard size triggers an advanced game mode, requiring the player to align four characters side by side to win.

It was created as a fun way to practice the basics of Java, and could be made in much simpler form but I made some unnecessary complication just to practice.
